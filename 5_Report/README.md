**REQUIREMENTS**

**INTRODUCTION**

- Air pollution is one of the critical ecological issues that have a direct impact on human health and ecological balance. Air pollution is not only affecting people's health but affecting environment which leads to acid rain, smog, deterioration of the ozone layer and global warming.
- Air pollution is a risk factor for different health conditions, including eye and skin diseases, irritation of the nose, throat and eyes. Air pollution additionally causes genuine conditions like heart stroke, lung cancer, pneumonia, bronchitis, trouble in breathing and coughing because of asthma.
- So, it is very crucial to monitor and control the air pollution. The most ideal approach to control air pollution is to monitor exceeded levels of air pollutants and need to take suitable activities to control it.

**FEATURES**

- **CO SENSOR**: Monitor the level of co emission.
- **LPG SENSOR**: Detect the LPG GAS LEAKAGE.
- **GPS**: Finds the current location of the vehicle.
- **GSM**: Sends the location to hub station.
- **BUZZER**: The buzzer will give an alert.
- **LCD:** The LCD (Liquid Crystal Display) shows the notifications.
- **ATmega 328:** The entire process is controlled and monitored.

**SWOT ANALYSIS**

**STRENGTH**:

- The data collected from air quality monitoring helps us assess impacts caused by poor air quality on public health.
- Air quality data helps us understand the mortality rate of any location due to air pollution. We can also access and compare the short term and long term diseases/disorders which are a result of air pollution.
- Based upon the data collected control measures can be devised for protection of environment and health of all living organisms.

**WEAKNESS:**

- Air pollution can also cause headaches, dizziness, and nausea. Long-term health effects from air pollution include heart disease, lung cancer, and respiratory diseases such as emphysema.
- Air pollution can also cause long-term damage to people's nerves, brain, kidneys, liver, and other organs.

**OPPORTUNITIES:**

- Air Pollution Detection System is used to monitor the Air Quality over a web server using Internet. It will trigger a buzzer when the air quality goes down beyond a certain level, means when there are sufficient amount of harmful gases present in the air like CO2, smoke, alcohol, benzene and NH3.
- Standards are a regulatory measure to set the target for pollution reduction and achieve clean air. Robust monitoring helps to guard against extreme events by alerting people and initiate action.

**THREATS:**

- The main threats to local air quality across the United States remain smog and particulate pollution, which combined or acting alone trigger millions of hospital visits and health complications for citizens every year.
- Air pollution can damage crops and trees in a variety of ways. Ground-level ozone can lead to reductions in agricultural crop and commercial forest yields, reduced growth and survivability of tree seedlings, and increased plant susceptibility to disease, pests and other environmental stresses.

**4W’s &IH**

**WHO**: This Air Pollution Detector System is used by the car owners and drivers to monitor and determine the root cause.

**WHAT**: Air Pollution Detector System is a hardware kit that helps to detects emission level of CO and LPG gas from vehicle. It also alerts the driver when emission level of CO and LPG gas exceeds threshold value.

**WHEN**: This System is very useful to track the level of gas emitted by the vehicle.

**WHERE**: It should be mandatory to all vehicles which has to be strictly implemented in new vehicles and the kit is also available to fit in all variants.

**HOW:** This project is implemented to monitor the emission of the gases from the vehicle by the emission test.Test report identifies the approved level of pollution.
